In the ajax method that is run by jquery, it looks for {option : new_option}
      option is the params in the server and new_option is the variable you defined earlier
url. option?option=blue that is how the new form would look like.
in the data thing in $ajax it gets sent to the option part in the new_options in the server
      (the server then takes it to the json, but that donen't mean that the js makes it go to the Json, its the server)
Read .success function
Ajax is like a trinagle of information.
When its running ERB and you want to add variables, you need to change it to the variables that you want.
      like the variable you just got from the jquery and javascript
